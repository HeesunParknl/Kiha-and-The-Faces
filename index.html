      <h3>Here's their story</h3>
      <p>
        The unrivaled star of the Korean indie scene, who have become so famous
        that the lyrics of one song are included in Korean textbooks. In 2008,
        their debut song "cheap coffee" quickly emerged as a novel alternative
        to the Korean music industry, capturing the public with a sense of
        experimentation and familiarity at the same time. It is a unique band
        with exciting sounds and folk-rock vocals that are subtly mixed with
        Korean psychedelic music from the 70s and British New Wave. Jang Ki-ha's
        unique conversational singing style and realistic lyrics featuring
        wordplay is very popular. In particular, they are well known for their
        charisma and passionate stage manners that overwhelms audiences on the
        live stage.
